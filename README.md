Project: Dynamic Restaking.

We hope you like our first rust project, and our first project involving blockchain! The general idea is a dynamic restaker that would strategize how to optimize ETH allocation between different strategies. In specific, our project was scoped to Lido (liquid staking) and EigenLayer (which would occur via the P2P API), hoping for a higher yield while managing risk. As an extension, we would love to implement more methods and allow users to opt into which they choose, acting as a risk management.

Because the Holesky Testnet has been down at the time of creation of this project, we were unable to rigorously test our mechanism. We tried circumventing this issue in Rust, but given more time and resources, we would need to test further to get a viable product. We nevertheless had a lot of fun in planning and implementing a rudimentary version of this mechanism, and we hope to work more with blockchain applications in the future!
